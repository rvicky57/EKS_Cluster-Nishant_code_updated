Initially, I received an unsupported block type error. 
In vpc.tf, I updated the terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws module from version 5.16.0 to 5.20.0. 
In versions.tf, I removed the random provider argument and updated the AWS provider version from 3.68.0 to 5.82.0."
While executing commission.sh to automate Terraform, I observed that the script was looking for a .tfvars file that wasn't included in the configuration,
and so I deployed the EKS cluster manually, and the updated code is working fine now
